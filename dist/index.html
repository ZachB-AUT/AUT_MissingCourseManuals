            <h1>Missing Course Manuals</h1>
            <p>
                When available, I find having a course manual to be an
                incredibly valuable resource. Not all classes publish course
                manuals, so in cases where a pre-existing course manual isn't
                available and I do well in a class, I have decided to create my
                own in the hope it will be of use to others.
